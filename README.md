## What is Deep Learning?

An intensive approach to Machine Learning, Deep Learning is inspired by the workings of the human brain and its biological neural networks. Architectures as deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and deep belief networks are made of multiple layers for the data to pass through before finally producing the output. Deep Learning serves to improve AI and make many of its applications possible; it is applied to many such fields of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, and drug design.
## What is Keras?

Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is a high-level API and can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano. Keras is all about enabling fast experimentation and prototyping while running seamlessly on CPU and GPU. It is user-friendly, modular, and extensible.
## Breast Cancer Detection â€“ Objective

To build a breast cancer classifier on an sklearn dataset that can accurately classify a histology image as benign or malignant.
